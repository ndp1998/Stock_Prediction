### Stock_Prediction
This is simple tool to predict future stock price, with the use of LSTM machine learning from tensorflow libraries. (Not to be used for actual stock trading)

## Project Description
In this project, you will be able to select the company you wish to predict and it will generate the forecasted price based on the past 60 days of closing price. The reason why I chose to use LSTM is because it is widely used for sequence prediction problems and have proven to be extremely effectively. It works well with this model because LSTM can store past important information and forget the less important information.
